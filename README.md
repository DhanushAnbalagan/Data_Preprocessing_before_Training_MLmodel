## Introduction

Data preprocessing and cleaning are crucial in any machine learning project. These steps ensure that the data used for modeling is accurate, consistent, and reliable, leading to better model performance. This project demonstrates various techniques for preparing data, including handling missing values, outlier detection and treatment, feature encoding, and normalization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features that require preprocessing before being fed into a machine learning model. The data includes numerical and categorical variables, some of which may have missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries. The dataset is hypothetical or sourced from a common repository used for machine learning practice.

## Installation

To run the preprocessing scripts, you need Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data Preprocessing Steps

The data preprocessing and cleaning process in this project includes:

1. **Handling Missing Data:** Techniques such as mean/mode/median imputation, and using more advanced methods like KNN imputation.
2. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identifying and handling outliers using methods like IQR and Z-score.
3. **Feature Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into numerical values using methods such as one-hot encoding.
4. **Normalization and Standardization:** Scaling numerical features to ensure all variables contribute equally to the model.
5. **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates and correcting inconsistent data entries.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and cleaning in machine learning. Properly preprocessed data leads to more accurate models and reliable predictions. The techniques demonstrated here are applicable to a wide range of machine learning problems.
